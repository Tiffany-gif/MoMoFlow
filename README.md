# MoMoFlow

## Team Name
Group 3

## Project Description
**MoMoFlow** is a tool designed for shop owners, freelancers, and small businesses that rely on MTN MoMo transactions. The system processes MoMo SMS data (in XML format), cleans and categorizes the data, and stores it in a relational database.  

On the frontend, a dashboard provides insights into:
- Cash-in (sales) vs Cash-out (expenses)  
- Daily, weekly, and monthly cashflow trends  
- Detection of high-value clients and frequent suppliers  
- Overall business performance overview  

This project demonstrates **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, relational database management, and frontend visualization** skills in a collaborative Agile workflow.
